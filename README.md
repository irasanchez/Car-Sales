# Module Project: Redux - Car Sales

In this project you are given the skeleton/structure/styling of a React app. There is even some state built in for you. Your job will be to implement React-Redux as the state management system for this application.

## Description

In this project you will implement Redux to manage the state for this React application.

# _Project - Car Sales_

- This is a really fun project, and one to show your family and friends when you've finished.
- You will be starting with a structured and styled app
- You have been commissioned to implement Redux as the state management system in this app
- You have the freedom to manage the state how you would like - ie, connecting multiple components to pass data directly to them, or maybe connecting one component, and then putting the data into a context object.

## _MVP Requirements:_

- Move the given state to the reducer as the initial state for the Redux store.
- Set up the Redux flow
- User should be able to add features to their car
- User should be able to remove added features from their car
- Total should update as user adds and removes features from their car

## Stretch Problems

Do not attempt stretch problems until MVP has been reached and a final commit has been made.

- Use Redux hooks instead of HOCs
- Implement React-Router and add a starter page where the user can choose a car. Each car should have different features that have different pricing. Have fun with this! It could end up being really cool.
- Look into the docs for Bulma and change up the styling.
- Implement an API from one of these sites [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=car+sales+api&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS809US809&oq=car+sales+api&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3580j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). I don't know if there are any good open APIs for this, so explore around. Check out what data these APIs return, and what you think would be fun to work with. The sky is the limit here!
